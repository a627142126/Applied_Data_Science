    "Please submit this assignment to the NYU Classes 'Assignments' section by 12:00pm on Monday, December 17, strictly labeling the assignments with the format **'ADS_HW1_(your net ID).ipynb'**. Be sure not to confuse Net ID (e.g. 'acs882') with N-number ('N166...'). This homework is here for you to better understand and practice the material; while you may discuss approaches to problems with your classmates (in fact, this is encouraged!), please ensure that all final code submitted is your own. You may reach out to the TA, Alex Shannon, at acs882@nyu.edu."
